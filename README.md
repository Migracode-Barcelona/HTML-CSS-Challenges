# Zoo Exercise Instructions

You have been hired by a zoo to build a website.

I’ve done the first part but it is full of mistakes. It’s your job to fix them. The client has sent over a list of alterations and recommendations that they want to fix the site with. 

You are encouraged to use Google to help you find the answers to these problems.

## 👩‍🔧 To work on the website from inside your CodeSpace or Visual Studio: 

Press Ctrl + Shift + P (Cmd + Shift + P on mac) and type: `CodeSwing: Open Swing...`

Press Enter, when you see `/workspaces/htmlcss-zoo/`, press Enter again. You should see the website preview on the right!

## 1) Introduction

First of all, we don’t want the logo to have a purple border. The logo has an ID of logo, make sure this has no border.

The first section has a class name of ‘introduction’. Give this section a white background. Add a paragraph to this section with the following text:

‘The zoo is open every day of the year and features three major biomes: the Tropic Zone, Temperate Territory, and the Polar Circle. From tropical birds, to snow leopards, grizzly bears, and one of the nation’s largest colonies of Antarctic penguins, there are animals to enjoy in every season.’

Most of the text on the page is very close together. Increase the amount of space of the text so that there's more breathing space.

## 2) Bears:

All the images of bears have the same border colour, can all these images be given a different border colour?

The images of the bears are also misaligned. Can all these images be vertically aligned to the top of the container.

## 3) Tigers

The purple headings are hard to read on dark backgrounds, change them to a lighter colour. Make sure it passes the WCAG AA standards for contrast. You can use this tool to help: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

Change the heading of this section to ‘Tiger Facts’, remove the subheading, and change the ordered list to an unordered list.

## 4) Giraffes

Change the background colour to #483C46, the section titles to #F4743B, and the paragraph color to #BEEE62.

Make the first paragraph have a larger font size.

## 5) News

Can the title of this section be centred in the middle of this page?

Add another news item with the title with today's date, and the title of ‘Which big cat are you?’

## 6) Learning

The buttons are a little hard to read. We’d like the buttons to have larger text, and also to change colour when you hover and focus on them.

We don’t like the hard corners here. Can you give the container in the section some rounded corners?

## 7) Membership

Give the paragraph a maximum width of 700 pixels, and keep in the middle by adjusting the margin.

## 8) Programs

The cards are stacked on top of each other which looks like a poor use of space. Change these so that they display horizontally across the screen.

Make sure all the links open in a new tab.

## 9) Badge

The badge that says ‘Opening 2021’ we’d like to be on the top right instead of the bottom right.

When a user hovers over the badge, add a transition so the change in colour is smoother.

## 10) New section

If you have time, add a new section for your favorite animal.
